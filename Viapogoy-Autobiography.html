     <b><h2 style="color:white; text-align:center; font-family: Courier;">I am Via Marie D. Pogoy, I was born on November 22, 2002, in Agujo Sta. Rosa Olango Lapu-Lapu City, Cebu, Philippines. We are six siblings in the family including my mother and father. I am the third-born child. My mother's name is Florepes D. Pogoy, and she is from Olango Island my father's name is Basilio E. Pogoy, and he is from Bohol. I have 2 brothers and 1 sister my brother's name is Frilan D. Pogoy he is the Oldest, and Russel D. Pogoy is the youngest, but sadly he passed away too early, and my sister is Maiden D. Pogoy is older than me. I took my elementary education at Sta. Rosa Elementary School, my Junior Highschool at Sta. Rosa National Highschool, and my Senior Highschool at Pajo National Highschool. I am currently studying now at Lapu-Lapu City College at Lapu-Lapu City, taking a BSIT major in computer technology program. I had a happy childhood living with my parents and my siblings. My family was happy and loving.</p>
      <!----2nd paragraph -->
     <b><p style="color:white; text-align:center;">I am blessed with the life that I have on this earth. We may not be rich but my parents treated me like a princess, providing all the things that I need and giving me all the things that I want. My hobbies are watching movies especially horror movies, eating a lot like everything that I see and my eyes will like it I will surely gonna taste it, and also I draw not that artistic drawing but I know how to draw but it depends on my mood when I draw. I also spend my free time hanging out with my friends. My dream was to become a hotdog, just being red and making children happy on their birthdays. My life is boring, I don't have that many accomplishments in life. I am now studying as a BSIT major in computer technology and this course is I don't know why I choose this one, it's really hard and there is one subject in the major subject that I am not good at it. Even though the path that I choose is hard, I know I can handle this and I will graduate in this program. I am a woman who doesn't have a dream course but wants to graduate and have a degree.</p>
       <!----3rd paragraph -->
     <b><p style="color:white; text-align:center;">Living in this world is very challenging but never stop trying every day to be happy. We may choose the paths that we don't desire, just be happy in every step that you step. Life is hard but never stop when you are not in the life that you want.</p>
